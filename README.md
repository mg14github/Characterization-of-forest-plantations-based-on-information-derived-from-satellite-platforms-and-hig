# Characterization-of-forest-plantations-based-on-information-derived-from-satellite-platforms-and-hig
The Mesopotamian region of Argentina concentrates 80% of the country's forest plantations. Information collected in the field was used and that provided by the Sentinel - 2 MSI and Sentinel-1 SAR GRD satellites, linear regression models were generated to estimate different forest state variables (basal area, volume, dominant height, density index) that allow characterizing the forest resource corresponding to commercial plantations of the genus Eucalyptus in the Concordia department of the province of Entre RÃ­os. The processing of the satellite images was carried out using Google Earth Engine to favor automation. The basal area predictor model had a (R2 ajustado 0,77 y RMSE 2,53 m2/ha) the volume with bark (adjusted R2) 0.75 and RMSE 62.1 m3 / ha) the dominant height (adjusted R2 0.66 and RMSE 4.89 m) the relative density index, evidenced an overestimation of the response variable. A difference of 6% was obtained considering the volume estimated from the model and the one calculated on the field inventory measurements. The estimated dominant height was positively correlated with the canopy height surveyed from the ICESat-2 satellite (ATL08) and both were logically related to the ages of the studied stands. This study reflects promising results in the estimation of key forest plantation variables from remote sensing information, linear regression models and data processing in the Google Earth Engine platform.
